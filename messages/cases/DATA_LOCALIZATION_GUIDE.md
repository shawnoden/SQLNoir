# Case Data Localization Guide

This document identifies all text strings within the case SQL databases (schemas) that would need localization. These strings are embedded in SQL INSERT statements that populate the in-browser SQLite databases players query during gameplay.

> **IMPORTANT**: Many of these strings contain CLUES that are critical for solving the case. Translating them incorrectly could break the game logic. Each string is flagged with its clue sensitivity level.

## General Notes

- Database column names (e.g., `description`, `transcript`) should NOT be translated — they are part of the SQL schema players query
- Table names should NOT be translated — players reference them in SQL queries
- Column names should NOT be translated — players reference them in WHERE clauses, JOINs, etc.
- Person names should generally NOT be translated — they are used as answers to cases
- Location names MAY be translated but must remain consistent across all tables within a case
- The `answer` field in each case definition (e.g., "Vincent Malone") must NEVER change — it's the solution check

### Cross-reference constraints
- Crime scene description mentions "trench coat" + "scar on left cheek" → must match suspects table
- Interview transcript for the culprit must clearly indicate guilt

## Translation Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Safe translations (can be done without breaking gameplay)
- Case narratives (brief, objectives, success messages, explanations) — in `/messages/cases/`
- UI strings — in `/messages/en.json`

### Phase 2: Careful translations (requires cross-referencing)
- Crime scene descriptions, witness statements, interview transcripts
- Must maintain exact cross-references between tables
- Each translated clue word must appear consistently across all tables

### Phase 3: Do NOT translate
- Person names (used as case answers)
- Table and column names (used in SQL queries)
- Technical identifiers (keycard IDs, dates as integers)
- SQL keywords in example queries

### Quality Assurance
For each translated case, the entire case must be play-tested to verify:
1. All clue cross-references still work
2. The correct answer can still be found through logical deduction
3. SQL queries using translated values return expected results
4. No clue text is ambiguous in the target language
