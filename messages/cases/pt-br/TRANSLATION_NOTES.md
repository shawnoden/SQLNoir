## General Rules Applied
1. **Character names** — NEVER translated (they are answer keys)
2. **Table and column names** — NEVER translated (players write SQL against them)
3. **Place names** — Real places kept as-is (Ocean Drive, Coconut Grove, Miami)
4. **Dates and IDs** — NEVER translated
5. **Crime types, descriptions, occupations, testimony, attire** — Translated to Portuguese
6. **Brand names** — Kept as-is (Lamborghini, etc.)
